## Add user
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -i 'http://0.0.0.0/api/users' --data '{
  "email": "llewellyn@zekini.com",
  "name": "Llewellyn",
  "password": "ban3@Batman"
}'

## Get users
curl -X GET -i 'http://0.0.0.0/api/users'

## To switch between data stores
Change the UserRepository at app/Providers/RepositoryServiceProvider.php
For CSV: Uncomment use App\Repository\Csv\UserRepository;
For Eloquent: Uncomment use App\Repository\Eloquent\UserRepository;

## Tests
./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate:fresh --seed && ./vendor/bin/sail artisan test

## Would normally have refactored
app/Repository/Csv/UserRepository.php has hardcoded "users.txt"
The validation only works against the MySQL implementation as it uses the model
Removed middleware to ease testing
